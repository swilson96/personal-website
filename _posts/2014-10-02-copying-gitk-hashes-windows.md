Do you use windows, cygwin, and git, and does gitk annoy you like crazy when you try to copy and paste commit hashes?

The solution is pretty simple: each time you need to copy a new hash to the clipboard, copy something _from a different field in gitk first_. Any old text will do.

For a full explanation see [my original post on the Softwire blog](http://www.softwire.com/blog/2014/08/07/copying-sha-1-hashes-from-gitk-to-the-clipboard/).

Alternatively, check out [sourcetree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), which could replace git gui and gitk altogether.
