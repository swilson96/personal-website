I'm a web developer, consultant and project manager at [www.softwire.com](http://www.softwire.com/) and occasionally [blog for them](http://www.softwire.com/blog/author/sjw/) too.

At the moment I live in Wellington, New Zealand and work remotely with the rest of my team being in London, which is a challenge in itself, but worth the effort to be able to live in this beautiful country.

You can find out more about my NZ adventures at my other blog [http://siandlucyinnz.weebly.com/](http://siandlucyinnz.weebly.com/) (which is rarely, if ever, updated) and my scrapbook [http://swilson96.tumblr.com/](http://swilson96.tumblr.com/) (slightly more frequently updated).

You can also find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/theStarvis), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swilson96), [github](https://github.com/swilson96), and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2686868/swilson).
